metab scalajs version
====================

ScalaJS version of small react app I wrote. 

Running
=======
start sbt...workbench will bind to port 12345..then run fullOptJS and once complete localhost:12345/index.html will 
render the site. 
 

Technologies
============
* [ScalaJS](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js)
* [Scalajs-react](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react)
* [ScalaCSS](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss)
* [uPickle](https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle-pprint)
* [workbench](https://github.com/lihaoyi/workbench)

No routing or redux like technologies for now everything is locally managed in state

App pulls in my local weather, subreddits I am interested in, and HN data into one easy to read page  on desktop and mobile
